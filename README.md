# NumericalAnalysis
Projects dedicated to Numerical Analysis studies. The first one discusses Linear Systems solving methods (direct and iterative) and the different ways to find Roots of a Function. The second one is about the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress an image, Interpolation methods and the application of Least Squares to real brazilian COVID-19 data.
